# RBDominantColor
iOS tool for selecting the dominant colors in the foreground of an image using opencv.

It was developed as part of [kloz.it](http://kloz.it), for determining the color of clothing from photos.

## Getting Started

Drag the src directory into your project. This should include the opencv framework, the RBDominantColor code, and the xml file used for face detection.

**Please Note:** RBDominantColor makes use of Objective C++, so you will need to change your build settings to compile your sources as Objective C++. This can be found under *Build Settings* -> *Apple LLVM - Language* -> *Compile Sources As*.

*TODO:* Make this work when the default option (Compile Sources As = According to File Type).
